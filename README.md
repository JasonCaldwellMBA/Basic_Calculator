### Introduction
This is a basic calculator that was developed with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Mocha. It meets and/or exceeds all of the mininum requirements and stretch goals for this project. Mouse, touch, keyboard, and numeric keypad inputs are accepted from the user. Also included is error checking and test cases.

### Minimum Requirements
[✓]: The calculator has a screen which displays numbers input by the user, or a summed total based on mathematical operations.  

[✓]: The calculator has buttons (`0-9`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `.`, `=`, `C`). 

Bonus: Extra buttons were added and are functional in the calculations: '(' and ')'.

[✓]: The calculator can perform the following operations (i.e. is a working calculator):  
* addition
* subtraction
* division
* multiplication  

[✓]: The 'C' button clears the running total/entered value (works like a clear button).  

[✓]: `=` returns the sum of the current operation.  

[✓]: All the necessary calculator buttons are assigned click events which result in some action being performed (be it updating the displayed value, or performing math).

### Stretch Goals
[✓]: Handles decimals.  

[✓]: Users can enter values/perform math with keyboard input (keypress). 

Bonus: Numeric keypad values and operators can be used.
