# JS Calculator
## Created by Jason Caldwell
#### December 2017

### Introduction
This is a basic calculator that was developed with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Mocha. It meets and/or exceeds all of the mininum requirements and stretch goals for this project. Both mouse and keyboard inputs are accepted from the user. Also included is error checking and test cases.

### Minimum Requirements
[✓]: The calculator has a screen which displays numbers input by the user, or a summed total based on mathematical operations.  

[✓]: The calculator has buttons (`0-9`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `.`, `=`, `C`). 

Bonus: Extra buttons were added and are functional in the calculations: '(' and ')'.

[✓]: The calculator can perform the following operations (i.e. is a working calculator):  
* addition
* subtraction
* division
* multiplication  

[✓]: The 'C' button clears the running total/entered value (works like a clear button).  

[✓]: `=` returns the sum of the current operation.  

[✓]: All the necessary calculator buttons are assigned click events which result in some action being performed (be it updating the displayed value, or performing math).

### Stretch Goals
[✓]: Handles decimals.  

[✓]: Users can enter values/perform math with keyboard input (keypress).  


### Future enhancements
* Accept number pad inputs.
* Mobile inputs interacting with a phone's number pad. Currently users can enter the various options on their device; but the input isn't going through the users phone's keyboard.
* Create a financial calculator (most likely will be a different project).
